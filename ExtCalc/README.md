#The Greatest of all Calculators!!!!!
Calc is an extension of the simple calculator language compiler found in the Calc directory

##Build

To build the code run the following:

'./build.sh'

That will configure cmake,
and run make

##Run

To run tests, write a text file with one line expressions(as many and as complicated as you like)
save that file and give it (with the path to it) as an argument to the demo.sh
script located in the higher level directory calc.

like so:

`./demo.sh <path to your test file>`

If you don't provide a test file then a simple file I made will be used.
