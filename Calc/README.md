#The Greatest of all Calculators!!!!!
Calc is a simple calculator language compiler that take's as input math
expressions.

##Build

To build simply cd into the build directory and rin the script called build.sh


##Run

To run tests, write a text file with one line expressions(as many and as complicated as you like)
save that file and give it (with the path to it) as an argument to the demo.sh
script located in the higher level directory calc.

If you don't provide a test file then a simple file I made will be used.

NOTE:
If expressions are VERY long stack overflows can occur due to deep recursion.
